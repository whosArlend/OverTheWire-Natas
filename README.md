# OverTheWire – Natas

This repository documents my learning progress through the **OverTheWire Natas** wargame.

Natas is a web-based wargame designed to help learners understand how common web application vulnerabilities occur and how they can be identified through analysis and logical thinking.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Track my personal learning progress
- Practice analyzing web application behavior
- Improve understanding of web security concepts
- Build consistent and structured documentation habits

## Scope
- Each level is documented in a separate file
- Write-ups focus on **analysis and learning outcomes**
- No passwords, flags, or sensitive credentials are included

## Disclaimer
This repository is created **for educational purposes only**.

All sensitive information such as passwords, flags, or credentials is intentionally redacted.  
The content focuses on explaining concepts and thought processes rather than providing direct solutions.

## Topics Practiced
This wargame explores various web application security concepts, including but not limited to:
- Common web vulnerability patterns
- Authentication and access control logic
- Client–server trust boundaries
- Input handling and validation
- Server-side misconfigurations
